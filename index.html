        <p>The schoolmaster was watching the two men climb toward him. One was on horseback, the other on foot. They had not yet tackled the abrupt rise leading to the schoolhouse built on the hillside. They were toiling onward, making slow progress in the snow, among the stones, on the vast expanse oft he high, deserted plateau. From time to time the horse stumbled. Without hearing anything yet, he could see breath issuing from the horses nostrils. One of the men, at east, knew the region. They were following the trail although it had disappeared days ago under a layer of dirty white snow. The schoolmaster calculated that it would take them half an hour to get onto the hill. It was cold; he went back into the school to get a sweater.</p>

        <p>He crossed the empty, frigid classroom. On the blackboard the four rivers of France, one drawn with four different colored chalks, had been flowing toward their estuaries for the past three days. Snow had suddenly fallen in mid-October after eight months of drought without the transition of rain, and the twenty pupils, more or less, who lived in the villages scattered over the plateau had stopped coming.  With fair weather they would return. Daru now heated only the single room that was lodging, adjoining the classroom and giving also onto the plateau to the east. Like the class cows, his window looked to the south too. On that side the school was a few kilometers from the point where the plateau began toslope toward the south. In clear weather could be seen the purple mass of the mountain range where the gap opened onto the desert.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>3</h2>
    <p>Somewhat warmed, Daru returned to the window from which he had first seen thetwo men. They were no longer visible. Hence they must have tackled the rise. The sky was not so dark, for the snow had stopped falling during the night. The morning had opened with a dirty light which had scarcely become brighter as the ceiling of clouds lifted. At two in the afternoon it seemed as if the day were merely beginning. But stillthis was better than those three days when the thick snow was falling amidst unbrokendarkness with little gusts of wind that rattled the double door of the class-room. Then Daru had spent long hoursin his room, leaving it only to go to the shed and feed thechickens or get some coal. Fortunately the delivery truck from Tadjid, the nearest villageto the north, had brought his supplies two days before the blizzard. It would return inforty-eight hours.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>4</h2>
        <p>Besides, he had enough to resist a siege, for the little room was cluttered with bags ofwheat that the administration left as a stock to distribute to those of his pupils whose families had suffered from the drought. Actually they had all been victims because theywere all poor. Every day Daru would distribute a ration to the children. They had missed it, he knew, during these bad days. Possibly one of the fathers would come this afternoonand he could supply them with grain. It was just a matter of carrying them over to the next harvest. Now shiploads of wheat were arriving from France and the worst was over.But it would be hard to forget that poverty, that army of ragged ghosts wandering in thesunlight, the plateaus burned to a cinder monthafter month, the earth shriveled up littleby little, literally scorched, every stone bursting into dust under one's foot. The sheep haddied then by thousands and even a few men, here and there, sometimes without anyone'sknowing.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>5</h2>
        <p>In contrast with such poverty, he who lived almost like a monk in his remoteschoolhouse, nonetheless satisfied with the little he had and with the rough life, had felt like a lord with his whitewashed walls, his narrow couch, his unpainted shelves, his well,and hisweekly provision of water and food. And suddenly this snow, without warning,without the foretaste of rain. This is the way the region was, cruel to live in, even withoutmen--who didn't help matters either. But Daru had been born here Everywhere else, he felt exiled.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>6</h2>
        <p>He stepped out onto the terrace in front of the schoolhouse. The two men were nowhalfway up the slope. He recognized the horseman as Balducci the old gendarme he had known for a long time. Balducci was holding on the end of a ropean Arab who was walking behind him with hands bound and head lowered. The gendarme waved a greetingto which Daru did not reply, lost as he was in contemplation of the Arab dressed in afaded blue jellaba, 2 his feet in sandals but covered with socks of heavy raw wool, his head surmounted by a narrow, short cheche. They were approaching. Balducci was holding back his horse in order not to hurt the Arab, and the group was advancing slowly. </p>
    <hr />

    <h2>7</h2>
        <p>Within earshot, Balducci shouted: "One hour to do the three kilometers from ElAmeur!" Daru did not answer. Short and square in his thick sweater he watched them climb. Not once had the Arab raised his head. "Hello," said Daru when they got up onto the terrace. "Come in and warm up." Balducci painfully got down from his horse without letting go the rope. From under his bristling mustache he smiled at the schoolmaster. His little dark eyes, deep-set under a tanned forehead, and his mouth surrounded with wrinkles made him look attentive and studious. Daru took the bridle ]led the horse to the shed, and came back to the two men, who were now waiting for him in the school. He ledthem into his room "I am going to heat up the classroom," he said. "We'll be morecomfortable there." When he entered the room again, Balducci was on the couch. He hadundone the rope tying him to the Arab, who had squashed near the stove. His hands stillbound, the cheche pushed back on his head, he was looking toward the window. At firstDaru noticed only his huge lips, fat, smooth, almost Negroid; yet his nose was straight,his eyes were dark and full of fever. The cheche revealed an obstinate forehead and,under the weathered skin now rather discolored by the cold, the whole face had a restlessand rebellious look that struck Daru when the Arab, turning his face toward him, lookedhim straight in the eyes. "Go into the other room," said the schoolmaster' "and I'll makeyou some mint tea." ''Thanks,'' Balducci said. "what a chore! How I long for retirement."And addressing his prisoner in Arabic: "Come on, you." The Arab got up and, slowly,holding his bound wrists in front of him, went into the classroom.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>8</h2>
        <p>With the tea, Daru brought a chair. But Balducci was already enthroned on the nearestpupil's desk and the Arab had squatted against the teacher's platform facing the stove,which stood between the desk and the window. When he held out the glass of tea to theprisoner, Daru hesitated at the sight of his bound hands. "He might perhaps be untied.""Sure," said Balducci. "That was forthe trip." He started to get to his feet. But Daru,setting the glass on the floor, had knelt beside the Arab. Without saying anything, the Arab watched him with his feverish eyes. Once his hands were free, he rubbed his swollen wrists against each other,took the glass of tea, and sucked up the burning liquid in swift little sips.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>9</h2>
        <p>"Good," said Daru. "And where are you headed?"</p>
        <p>Balducci withdrew his mustache form the tea. "Here, Son."</p>
        <p>"Odd pupils! And you're spending the night?"</p>
        <p>"No. I'm going back to El Ameur. And you will devliver this fellow to TInguit. He is expected at police headquarters."</p>
        <p>Balducci was looking at Daru with a friendly little smile.</p>
        <p>"What's this story?" asked the schoolmaster. "Are you pulling my leg?"</p>
        <p>"No, son. Those are the orders."</p>
        <p>"The orders? I'm not..." Daru hesitated, not wanting to hurt the old Corsican.</p>
        <p>"I mean, that's not my job" "What! What's the meaning of that? In wartime people do all kinds of jobs."</p>
        <p>"Then I'll wait for the declaration of war!"</p>
        <p>Balducci nodded.</p>
        <p>"O.K. But the orders exist and tehy concern you too. Things are brewing, it appears. There is talk of a forthcoming revolt. We are mobilized, in away.</p>
        <p>Daru still had his obstinate look.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>10</h2>
      <p>"Listen, Son," Balducci said.</p>
      <p>"I like you and you must understand. There's only adozen of us at El Ameur to patrol throughout the whole territory of a small department 4and I must get back in a hurry. I was told to hand this guy over to you and return withoutdelay. He couldn't be kept there. His village was beginning to stir; they wanted to takehim back. You must take him to Tinguit tomorrow before the day is over. Twentykilometers shouldn't faze a husky fellow like you. After that, allwill be over. You'll comeback to your pupils and your comfortable life." </p>
    <hr />

    <h2>11</h2>
      <p>Behind the wall the horse could be heard snorting and pawing the earth. Daru waslooking out the window. Decidedly, the weather was clearing and the light was increasingover the snowy plateau. When all the snow had melted, the sun would take over againand once more would burn the fields of stone. For days, still, the unchanging sky wouldshed its dry light on the solitary expanse where nothing had any connection with man.</p>
      <p>"After all," he said, turning around toward Balducci, "what did he do?" And, beforethe gendarme had opened his mouth, he asked: "Does he speak French?"</p>
      <p>"No, not a word. We had been looking for him for a month, but they were hiding him.He killed his cousin."</p>
      <p>"Is he against us?"</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>12</h2>
      <p>"I don't think so. But you can never be sure."</p>
      <p>"Why did he kill?"</p>
      <p>"A family squabble, I think one owned the other grain, it seems. IT's not all clear. In short, he killed his cousin with a billhook. You know, like a sheep, kreeck!"</p>
      <p>Balducci made the gesture of drawing a blade across his throat and the Arab, his attention attracted, watched him with a sort of anxiety. Dam felt a suddent wrath against the mall, against all men with their rotten spite, their tireless hates, their blood lust.</p>
      <p>"Thanks, kid," Balducci said. "And now, I'm off."</p>
      <p>He got up and went toward the Arab, taking a small rope from his pocket.</p>
      <p>"What are you doing?" Daru asked dryly.</p>
      <p>Balducci, disconcerted, showed him the rope.</p>
      <p>"Don't bother."</p>
      <p>The old gendarmy hesitated. "It's up to you. Of course, you are armed?"</p>
      <p>"I have my shotgun."</p>
      <p>"Where?"</p>
      <p>"In the trunk."</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>13</h2>
      <p>"You ought to have it near your bed."</p>
      <p>"Why? I have nothing to fear."</p>
      <p>"You're crazy, son. If there's an uprising, no one is safe, we're all in the same boat."</p>
      <p>"I'll defend myself. I'll have time to see them coming."</p>
      <p>Balducci began to laugh, then suddenly the mustache covered the white teeth</p>
      <p>"You'll have time? O.K. That's just what I was saying. You have always been a little cracked. That's why I like you, my son was like that."</p>
      <p>At the same time he took out his revolver and put it on the desk.</p>
      <p>"Keep it; I don't need two weapons from here to El Ameur."</p>
      <p>"The revolver shone against the black paint of the table. When the gendarme turnedtoward him, the schoolmastcr caught the smell of leather and horseflesh. "Listen,Balducci," Daru said suddenly, "every bit of this disgusts me, and first of all your fellowhere. But I won't hand him over. Fight, yes, if I have to. But not that."</p>
      <p>The old gendarme stood in front of him and looked at him severely.</p>
      <p>"You're being a fool," he said slowly. "I don't like it either. You don't get used toputting a rope on a man even after vears of it, and you're even ashamedÑyes, ashamed.But you can't let them have their way."</p>
      <p>"I won't hand him over," Daru said again.</p>
      <p>"It's an order, son, and I repeat it."</p>
      <p>"That's right. Repeat to them what I've said to you: I won't hand him over."</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>14</h2>
      <p>Balducci made a visible effort to reflect. He looked at the Arab and at Daru. At last hedecided.</p>
      <p>"No, I won't tell them anything. If you want to drop us, go ahead. I'll not denounceyou. I have an order to deliver the prisoner and I'm doing so. And now you'll just sign thispaper for me."</p>
      <p>"There's no need. I'll not deny that you left him with me."</p>
      <p>"Don't be mean with me. I know you'll tell the truth. You're from hereabouts and youare a man. But you must sign, that's the rule."</p>
      <p>Daru opened his drawer, took out a little square bottle of purple ink, the red woodenpenholder with the "sergeant-major" pen he used for making models of penmanship, andsigned. The gendarme carfully folded the paper and put it into his wallet. Then he movedtoward the door.</p>
      <p>"I'll see you off," Daru said.</p>
      <p>"No," said Balducci. "There's no use being polite. You insulted me."</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>15</h2>
      <p>He looked at the Arab, motionless in the same spot, sniffed peevishly, and turnedaway toward the door. "Good-by, son," he said. The door shut behind him. Balducci appeared suddenly outside the window and then disappeared. His footsteps were muffledby the snow. The horse stirred on the other sideof the wall and several chickens flutteredin fright. A moment later Balducci reappeared outside the window leading the horse bythe bridle. He walked toward the little rise without turning around and disappeared fromsight with the horse following him. Abig stone could be heard bouncing down. Daruwalked back toward the prisoner, who, without stirring, never took his eyes off him.</p>
      <p>"Wait," the schoolmaster said in Arabic and went toward the bedroom. As he was goingthrough the door, he had a second thought, went to the desk, took the revolver, and stuckit in his pocket. Then, without looking back, he went into his room.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>16</h2>
      <p>For some time he lay on his couch watching the sky gradually close over, listening tothe silence. It was this silence that had seemed painful to him during the first days here,after the war. He had requested a post in the little town at the base of the foothills separating the upper platueas from the desert. There, rocky walls, green and black to thenorth, pink and lavender tothe south, marked the frontier of eternal summer. He had beennamed to a post farther north, on the plateau itself. In the beginning, the solitude and thesilence had been hard for him on these wastelands peopled only by stones. Occasionally,furrows suggested cultivation, but they had been dug to uncover a certain kind of stonegood for building. The only plowing here was to harvest rocks. Elsewhere a thin layer ofsoil accumulated in the hollows would be scraped out to enrich palty village gardens.Thisis the way it was: bare rock covered three quarters of the region. Towns sprang up,flourished, then disappeared; men came by, loved one another or fought bitterly, thendied. No one in this desert, neither he nor his guest, mattered. And yet, outside thisdesertneither or them, Daru knew, could have really lived.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>17</h2>
      <p>When he got up, no noise came from the classroom. He was amazed at the unmixedjoy he derived from the mere thought that the Arab might have fled and that he would bealone with no decision to make. But theprisoner was there. He had merely stretched out between the stove and the desk. With eyes open, he was staring at the ceiling. In thatposition, his thick lips were particularly noticeable, giving him a pouting look. "Come,"said Daru. The Arab got up and followed him. In the bedroom, the schoolmaster pointedto a chair near the table under the window. The Arab sat down without taking his eyes off Daru.</p>
      <p>"Are you hungry?"</p>
      <p>"Yes," the prisoner said.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>18</h2>
      <p>Daru set the table for two. He took flour and oil, shaped a cake in a frying-pan, and lighted the litde stove that functioned on bottled gas. While the cake was cooking, he went out to the shed to get cheese, eggs, dates and condensed mflk. When the cake was done he set it on the window sill to cool, heated some condensed milk diluted with water,and beat up the eggs into an omelette. In one of his motions he knocked against therevolver stuck m his right pocket. He set the bowl down, went into the classroom and puttherevolver in his desk drawer. When he came back to the room night was falling. He puton the light and served the Arab. "Eat," he said. The Arab took a piece of the cake, liftedit eagerly to his mouth, and stopped short.</p>
      <p>"After you. I'll eat too."</p>
      <p>The thick lips opened slightly. The Arab hesitated, then bit into the cake determinedly.</p>
      <p>The meal over, the Arab looked at the schoolaster. "Are you the judge?"</p>
      <p>"No, I'm simply keeping you until tomorrow."</p>
      <p>"Why do you eat with me?"</p>
      <p>"I'm hungry."</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>19</h2>
      <p>The Arab fell silent. Daru got up and went out. He brought back a folding bed from the shed, set it up between the table and the stove, perpendicular to his own bed. From alarge suitcase which, upright in a corner, served as a shelf for papers, he took twoblankets and arranged them on the camp bed. Then he stopped, felt useless, and sat downon his bed. There was nothing more to do or to get ready. He had to look at this man. Helooked at him, therefore, trying to imagine his face bursting with rage. He couldn't do so.He could see nothing but the dark yet shining eyes and the animal mouth.</p>
      <p>"Why did you kill him?" he asked in a voice whose hostile tone surprised him.</p>
      <p>The Arab looked away.</p>
      <p>"He ran away. I ran after him."</p>
      <p>He raised his eyes to Daru again and they were full of a sort of woeful interrogation. "Now what will they do to me?"</p>
      <p>"Are you afraid?"</p>
      <p>He stiffened, turning his eyes away.</p>
      <p>"Are you sorry?"</p>
      <p>"The arab stared at him openmouthed.  Obviously he did not understand. Daru'sannoyance was growing. At the same time he felt awkward and self-conscious with hisbig body wedged between the two beds.</p>
      <p>"Lie down there," he said impatiently. "That's your bed."</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>20</h2>
      <p>The Arab didn't move. He called to Daru:</p>
      <p>"Tell me!"</p>
      <p>The schoolmaster looked at him.</p>
      <p>"Is the gendarme coming back tomorrow?"</p>
      <p>"I don't know. Why?"</p>
      <p>The prisoner got up and stretched out on top of the blankets, his feet toward the window. The light from the electric bulb shone straight into his eyes and he closed them at once.</p>
      <p>"Why?" Daru repeated, standing beside the bed.</p>
      <p>The Arab opened his eyes under the blinding light and looked at him, trying not to blink.</p>
      <p>"Come with us," he said.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>21</h2>
      <p>In the middle of the night, Daru was still not asleep. He had gone to bed afterundressing completely; he generally slept naked. But when he suddenly realized that hehad nothing on, he hesitated. He felt vulnerable and the temptation came to him to put hisclothes back on. Then he shrugged his shoulders; after all, he wasn't a child and, if needbe, he could break his adversary in two. From his bed he could observe him, lying on hisback, still motionless with his eyes closed under the harsh light. When Daru turned outthe light, the darkness seemed to coagulate all of a sudden. Little bv little, the night cameback to life in the window where thestarless skv was stirring gently. The schoolmastersoon made out the body lying at his feet. The Arab still did not move, but his eyesseemed open. A light wind was prowling around the schoolhouse. Perhaps it would driveaway the cIouds and the sin would reappear.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>22</h2>
      <p>During the night the wind increased. The hens fluttered a little and then were silent.The Arab turned over on his side with his back to Daru, who thought he heard him moan.Then he listened for his guest's breathing, become heavier and more regular. He listenedto that breath so close to him and mused without being able to go to sleep. In this roomwhere he had been sleeping alone for a year, this presence bothered him. But it botheredhim also by imposing on him a sort of brotherhoodhe knew well but refused to accept inthe present circumstances. Men who share the same rooms, soldiers or prisoners, developa strange alliance as if, having cast off their armor with their clothing, they fraternizedevery evening, over and above their differences, in the ancient community of dream andfatigue. But Daru shook himself; he didn't like such musings, and it was essential tosleep.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>23</h2>
      <p>A little later, however, when the Arab stirred slightly, the schoolmaster was still notasleep. When the prisoner made a second move, he stiffened, on the alert. The Arab waslifting himself slowly on his arms with almost the motion of a sleepwalker. Seatedupright in bed, he waited motionless without turning his head toward Daru, as if he werelistening attentively. Daru did not stir; it had just occurred to him that the revolver wasstill in the drawer of his desk. It was better to act at once. Yet he continued to observe theprisoner, who, with the same slithery motion, put his feet on the ground, waitedagain,then began to stand up slowly. Daru was about to call out to him when the Arab began towalk, in a quite natural but extraordinarily silent way. He was heading toward the door atthe end of the room that opened into the shed. He lifted the latch with precaution andwent out, pushing the door behind him but without shutting it. Daru had not stirred. "Heis running away," he merely thought. "Good riddance!" Yet he listened attentively. Thehens were not fluttering; the guest must be on the plateau. Afaint sound of water reachedhim, and he didn't know what it was until the Arab again stood framed in the doorway,closed the door carefully, and came back to bed without a sound. Then Daru turned hisback on him and fell asleep. Still later he seemed, from the depths of his sleep, to hearfurtive steps around the schoolhouse. "I'm dreaming! I'm dreaming!" he repeated tohimself. And he went on sleeping.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>24</h2>
      <p>When he awoke, the sky was clear; the loose window let in a cold, pure air. The Arabwas asleep, hunched up under the blankets now, his mouth open, utterly relaxed. Butwhen Daru shook him, he started dreadfully staring at Daru with wild eyes as if he hadnever seen him and such a frightened expression that the schoolmaster stepped back."Don't be afraid. It's me. You must eat." The Arab nodded his head and said yes. Calmhad returned to his face, but his expression was vacant and listless. </p>
    <hr />

    <h2>25</h2>
      <p>The coffee was ready. They drank it seated together on the folding bed as theymunched their pieces of the cake. Then Daru led the Arab under the shed and showedhim the faucet where he washed. He went back into the room, folded the blankets and thebed, made his own bed and put the room in order. Then he went through the classroomand out onto the errace. The sun was already rising in the blue sky; a soft, bright lightwas bathing the deserted plateau. On the ridge the snow was melting in spots. Ttlc stoneswere about to reappear. Crouched on the edge of the plateau, the schoolmaster looked atthe deserted expanse. He thought of Balducci. He had hurt him, for he had sent him off ina way as if he didn't want to bc associated with him. He could still hear the gendarme'sfarewell and, without knowing why, he felt strangely empty and vulnerable. At thatmoment, from the other side of the schoolhouse, the prisoner coughed. Daru listened tohim almost despite himself and then furious, threw a pebble that whistled through the airbefore sinking into the snow. That man's stupid crime revolted him, but to had him overwas contrary to honor. Merely thinking of it made him smart with humiliation. And hecursed at one and the same time his own people who had sent him this Arab and the Arabtoo who had dared to kill and not managed to get away. Dary got up, walked in a circleon the terrace, waited motionless, and then went back into the schoolhouse. </p>
    <hr />

    <h2>26</h2>
      <p>The Arab, leaning over the cement floor of the shed, was washing his teeth with twofingers. Daru looked at him and said: "Come." He went back into the room ahead of theprisoner. He slipped a hunting-jacket on over his sweater and put on walking-shoes.Standing, he waited until the Arab had put on his cheche and sandals. They went into theclassroom and the schoolmaster pointed to the exit, saying: "Go ahead." The fellow didn'tbudge. "I'm coming," said Daru. The Arab went out. Daru went back into the room andmade a package of pieces of rusk, dates, and sugar. In the classroom, before going out, hehesitated a second in front of his desk, then crossed thethreshold and locked the door."That's the way," he said. He started toward the east, followed by the prisoner. But, ashort distance from the schoolhouse, he thought he heard a slight sound behind them. Heretraced his steps and examined the surroundingsof the house, there was no one there.The Arab watched him without seeming to understand. "Come on," said Daru.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>27</h2>
      <p>They walked for an hour and rested beside a sharp peak of limestone. The snow wasmelting faster and faster and the sun was drinkingup the puddles at once, rapidlycleaning the plateau, which gradually dried and vibrated like the air itself. When theyresumed walking, the ground rang under their feet. From time to time a bird rent thespace in front of them with a joyful cry. Daru breathed in deeply the fresh morning light.He felt a sort of rapture before the vast familiar expanse, now almost entirely yellowunder its dome of blue sky. They walked an hour more, descending toward the south.They reached a level height made up of crumbly rocks. From there on, the plateau slopeddown, eastward, toward a low plain where there were a few spindly trees and, to thesouth, toward outcroppings of rock that gave the landscape a chaotic look.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>28</h2>
      <p>Daru surveyed the two directions. There was nothing but the sky on the horizon. Nota man could be seen. He turned toward the Arab, who was looking at him blankly. Daruheld out the package to him. "Take it," he said. "There are dates, bread, and sugar. Youcan hold out for two days. Here are a thousand francs too." The Arab took the packageand the money but kept his full hands at chest level as if he didn't know what to do withwhat was being given him. "Now look," the schoolmaster said as he pointed in thedirection of the east, "there's the wayto Tinguit. You have a two-hour walk. At Tinguityou'll find the administration and the police. They are expecting you." The Arab lookedtoward the east, still holding the package and the money against his chest. Daru took hiselbow and turned him ratherroughly toward the south. At the foot of the height on whichthey stood could be seen a faint path. "That's the trail across the plateau. In a day's walkfrom here you'll find pasturelands and the first nomads. They'll take you in and shelteryou accordingto their law." The Arab had now turned toward Daru and a sort of panicwas visible in his expression. "Listen," he said. Daru shook his head: "No, be quiet. NowI'm leaving you." He turned his back on him, took two long steps in the direction of theschool, looking hesitantly at the motionless Arab and started off again. For a few minuteshe heard nothing but his own step resounding on the cold ground and did not turn hishead. A moment later however he turned around. The Arab was still there on the edge ofthe hill his arms hanging now, and he was looking at the schoolmaster. Daru feltsomething rise in his throat. But he swore with impatience, waved vaguely, and startedoff again. He had already gone some distance when he again stopped and looked. Therewas no longer anyone on the hill.</p>

The rock-ficelds to the south stoodout sharply against the blue sky but on the plain to the east a steamy heat was alreadyrising. And in that slight haze Daru with heavy heart made out the Arab walking slowlyon the road to prison.</p>

      <p>A little later standing before the window of thc classroom the school master waswatching the clear light bathing the whole surface of the plateau but he hardly saw it.Behind him on the blackboard among the winding French rivers sprawled the clumsilychalked-up words he had just read. "You handcd over our brothnr. You will pay for this."Daru looked at the sky, the plateau and beyond the invisible lands stretchingall the wayto the sea. In this vast landscape he had loved so much, he was alone.</p>
